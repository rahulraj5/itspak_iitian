Experienced teachers are considered to be most capable because they have their own techniques of teaching. Teachers should have the ability to motivate their students for better performance. The professionalism of the teacher regarding education and learning standards matters a lot for cracking this exam.

Added to that, the system of negative marks, where candidates lose marks on marking incorrect answers increases their worries. Therefore, scoring high in this exam becomes difficult, and this increases the anxiety level of the candidates. We understand this state of the aspirants before answering any question due to the fear of negative marking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thus, <strong><a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/\">Dr. IITian</a></strong> comes up with some tips which can help students to avoid negative marks in JEE Main so that they do not end up wasting their hard-earned score. Before we move on to the methods to avoid negative marking, it is important to know &ldquo;why is the idea of negative marks being included in the exam?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;<strong>What is the Need to Introduce Negative Marking?</strong></span></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To make sure that there is honest conduction of the examination where students do not indulge in blind guesswork for increasing their score, most of the competitive exams including JEE Main, have a system of punishing students in the form of negative marks. In JEE Main, one-fourth of the total mark of a question is subtracted as negative marking, if it is attempted incorrectly. Until and unless you are entirely sure, it is suggested that you do not attempt such a question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you mark a question inaccurately, not only it leads to the wastage of time but also you will get a negative score in that question, which will result in lowering your overall score. So, the best method is to avoid guesswork and utilize that time to solve questions that you are sure will bring you marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>These are the top reasons which lead to Negative Marking</strong></span></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> 1. Overconfidence: </strong>It is good to be confident during the examination. But, there is a very slight gap in Confidence and Overconfidence. Students often tick the answer without reading questions thoroughly. This must be avoided during <a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/blogdetail/How-to-Prepare-for-IIT-JEE\">NEET and IIT JEE exams</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> 2. Excitement: </strong>Many aspirants appear in NEET or IIT-JEE exams for the first time. They do mistakes due to excitement. In NEET and IIT-JEE, you not only need to read questions carefully but you should also read thoroughly the four options as well before selecting the right one. Even if you find the correct answer in the first option, go through the other options carefully as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> 3. Greed: </strong>Most of the candidates make mistakes due to greed. They think that the correct answer will award them 4 marks. Hence, they attempt too many questions without knowing the correct answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>4. Luck Testing:</strong> Some candidates test their luck during the exam. They blindly tick random options without knowing the right answer or even reading the question paper. These students usually end up getting marks like -10, -26, -35, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>5. Wrong Filling of OMR Sheet:</strong> In <strong>NEET and IIT-JEE</strong>, you need to record your answer in an OMR sheet by circling the right option. Many students make mistakes while filling the OMR sheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Tips to Avoid Negative Marking in IIT-JEE &amp; NEET Exams</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>1. Be a Better Judge of the Problems: </strong>With adequate practice, just by reading the question once, you will get an idea of whether the question can be attempted or not. You should make three sections where the question can be placed - an easy one, which can be solved within a few minutes, a common one which will take a considerable amount of time and the last category should be allowed to those questions which need to be left. If the question is easy, you can attempt it in one go and move on to the next question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If the question is moderate, you can mark it and solve it later, and if the question belongs to the last category, you need to avoid such type of questions. Following these strategies will assure that you do not fall prey to negative marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> 2. Better Time Management:</strong> You can practice mock tests after you have completed your preparation. Appearing in mock tests will help you in making a strategy of attempting the paper in the specified time. With better time management, you will feel organized and the chances of doing silly mistakes will get eliminated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>3. Avoid Silly Mistakes: </strong>&nbsp;Be it exam fear or just carelessness, students often commit silly mistakes and lose valuable marks. Listed below are some general types of silly mistakes, and we have also provided ways to avoid them:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> &bull; Calculation Errors: </strong>This is the most common type of silly error, where students use the correct formula but end up making a calculation error and thus arrive at a wrong statement.<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> &bull; Marking the Wrong Option:</strong> Often, all the options have related values with only the units being different, or sometimes the options vary only in the number of zeros. You need to practice extreme caution while marking these questions.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>&bull; Misreading the Question:</strong> At times, students mark a wrong question because they fail to read the question properly. Say, a question asks you to mark the incorrect option but you end up marking the correct one. So, you need to read and understand the question carefully and then only mark the answer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>4. Smart Guesswork: </strong>As far as JEE Main exam is concerned, you can&rsquo;t blindly follow your intuition. However, you can use smart guesswork, where you can guess the correct option by the process of eliminating the wrong options, or by using a technique of substitution, where you can put the values given in the options and mark the right one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>5. Concentrate and Relax: </strong>Appearing for the exam with a confused mindset will make matters more critical, and you will end up doing mistakes. You need to relax so that your brain can perform to its full potential. A high level of concentration is required for improving speed, and you will notice that you can solve questions correctly only when you are cool and relaxed. Learn to overcome stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>To get FREE Tips &amp; Tricks <a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/registration\">register here</a>...</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'tips-to-avoid-negative-marking-in-neet-jee1.jpg', 'Dr. IITian', '2020-01-23'),

The first time started in 2013, the exam has replaced past AIPMT (All India Pre-Medical Test) to serve as a general platform for medical/dental admissions in India.</span></span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">Although the <a href=\"https://cbseneet.nic.in/\">NEET Entrance Exam</a> was conceived as a universal gateway for admissions in <strong>MBBS/BDS</strong>, it initially didn&#39;t serve the plan in 2013 as many colleges secured a stay order from the apex court for conducting private entrance examinations for admissions to their own courses.</span></span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">On the 18th of July, 2013, the Supreme Court passed a very uncertain verdict canceling the NEET exam while responding to multiple requests which had challenged the legality of the examination based on the argument of dilution of autonomous admission rights of colleges and universities. However, NEET has reinstated in 2016 after a 5-judge constitutional bench of the apex court overruled the earlier judgment. In 2017, it became the only window for the entrance examination for all medical and dental seats in India at Undergraduate level aside from the seats offered at JIPMER MBBS and AIIMS MBBS.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">A complete of 14,10,754 candidates appeared in NEET-2019 for the 1,02,586 MBBS/BDS seats available across 842 medical and dental colleges respectively within the country.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">Approx Exam Dates:</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>NEET 2020</strong> is predicted to be conducted by May 3rd this year. As per its exam pattern which follows the AIPMT, NEET is going to be held as a pen-paper based exam with Hindi, English, Gujarati, Marathi, Oriya, Bengali, Assamese, Telugu, Tamil and Kannada available as language choices. The paper will comprise 180 multiple choice questions which will have to be attempted during a span of three hours.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">The syllabus of NEET, provided by the Medical Council of India (MCI) after the survey of various State syllabi also as those prepared by CBSE, NCERT, and COBSE, which incorporates several topics and chapters from Class 11 and class 12. Out of the 180 questions, 45 questions each are going to be from Physics and Chemistry and 90 questions are going to be from the Biology section, consisting of Botany and Zoology sub-sections.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">The exam is going to be out of a total of 720 marks. Each question will carry 4 marks while 1 mark is going to be deducted for an inaccurate answer. This implies that aspirants will be having average only around a minute at their disposal to attempt one question, so speed and precision are the key factors.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">How To Apply For The Exam?</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">The application form for NEET 2019 is expected to start in online mode from December 2, 2019, onward while the admit card will likely be issued in April end. Those engaged in applying should ensure that they must clear the given eligibility standards. Only those that have completed a minimum of 17 years of age at the time of admissions or will complete 17 years as on or before December 31, 2019, are going to be eligible for admissions through NEET.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">Also, in terms of educational eligibility, General Category candidates should have secured a minimum of 50% marks in PCB subjects (in addition to obtaining pass marks in English) while SC/ ST/ OBC aspirants should have secured 40% scores in PCB in their Class 12 qualifying exam.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">Now we will discuss the top reasons why should one go for NEET.</span></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\">The aim of NEET is to possess one standardized entrance test for medical courses and it&#39;s a decent move to enhance the quality of medical education in INDIA. Here are some privileges of being a NEET aspirant:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>1. The advantages of a common entrance test:</strong> NEET would stop Private Medical Colleges and Deemed Universities from holding their own set of entrance examinations. Also, it could prevent rigging the rankings to induce people who don&rsquo;t deserve to become Doctors into the system.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>2. Reduced pressure among students:</strong> Fewer entrance tests for admission into medical colleges will reduce the pressure of the candidates who are in anxiety while preparing for various tests and covering different syllabuses. With the help of NEET, they will become experts in one exam pattern or syllabus. It also makes the aspirants more positive and determined.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>3. Students will get more extra time:</strong> Students were expected to solve 200 questions in 3 hours, in AIPMT Prelims Test. Whereas in NEET, they&#39;re required to solve only 180 questions within the same duration. This provides them more time to think and focus which will translate to be a plus point for the aspirants. They will be less worried about missing out questions and from the additional time, they will get the chance to look back on the paper completely. They will get a much better chance to score better.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>4. Equal opportunity for everyone:&nbsp;</strong>Aspirants will have a reasonable chance to secure a seat in any medical college in any state. They could get the seat into the foremost prestigious college within the nation by appearing the NEET exam. From that result, it&#39;ll estimate where the students stand against all the competition and race for the seat.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>5. NEET doesn&rsquo;t affect reservations for students:</strong><br />\r\nStates can apply their old reservation system as said by their state governments. eg: Nearly 69% of medical jobs in Tamil Nadu were in the reserved category but based on Class 12 results. Now the rankings will be based on NEET marks but the reservations remain at 69%.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>6. Fair and transparent process:</strong> The state and independent entrances exams have hardly been honest or transparent. There are multiple episodes of paper leaks and scams from various state entrances and private medical colleges. NEET will stop a repetition of such incidents.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>7. No more seats blocking scams or corruption:</strong> This is one of the most popular aspects of medical education. It happens more in the states which have an infinite number of private medical colleges. So, as NEET aspirants you don&rsquo;t need to bother. In order to this common entrance exam for medical education, there&#39;ll be no back-office corruption and no taking of substantial donations to ensure seats. Getting admission in a prestigious medical university will totally depend on your NEET Score.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'NEET_2020.jpg', 'Dr. IITian', '2020-01-27');

(26, 'How To Prepare For School Final Exams', 'How-To-Prepare-For-School-Final-Exams', '<p><strong>Final Exams</strong> are the last obstacle for the students to the next class. These exams carry a lot of weight so every student must appear in the exam at the end of their academic year. No matter, how much have you studied during the year but in the few days before the examination, try to do your best and prepare yourself for the exams. Here are some helpful and useful ways about <strong>how to prepare for final exams</strong> in one month and get everything else done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Time Management:</strong> Manage the remaining time for preparations and revision of all the subjects. Keep a record of what you&rsquo;ve revised rather than repeating the same topics. Create a balanced study program so that you will be able to study all the subjects. Don&rsquo;t mix up all the subjects. Make a time table of all the tasks you have to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Prepare Revision Notes:</strong> With the comprehensive syllabus of subjects, it becomes difficult to revise all the topics before the examinations. Prepare a notepad and point the notes for the important concepts which you can use to brush off for the Exam Preparation. Avoid mugging up at last time because it can result in forgetting everything you have learned. Instead, pick up your brief notes which you&rsquo;ve made while the subject was going on in the classroom or coaching. Reading the notes at the final preparation can help you remember all the main concepts and write good answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Solve Previous Years Question Papers:</strong> One of the most fruitful ways to prepare for exams when you don&rsquo;t have much time is to solve the previous year&rsquo;s question papers. This ensures you to know the format of the question paper and get you to hang out the exam time limit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Never Cram Before the Exam:</strong> Almost all the students have a habit of learning and Cramming lessons and concepts before the start of the exam. This is totally wrong. It is advisable not to read new topics before the exam as you may forget the things you have already know. Learning before the exam is just like Cramming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Don&rsquo;t Panic!</strong> Don&rsquo;t let stress affect you. Don&rsquo;t nervous while <a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/\">preparing for the exams</a>, it&rsquo;s just an exam. Yes, you have a huge syllabus to cover up and also there are a lot of expectations. But, do not let stress overwhelm your preparations. At the time of the exam, if a question seems too difficult, write the rest of the questions you know, and then return to the ones you left blank. Stay calm and tell yourself that you will do it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Write Neat, Present Well:</strong> Presenting your answer sheet in a proper way has more chances of getting good marks in the subjects. For this, practice more and more for writing better answers in exams so that you can score well. Use your time properly to get the maximum result out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Revise Within 24 Hours:</strong> Firstly, make sure that you don&rsquo;t touch uncovered syllabus or unlearned concepts a few days before your exams and if you do so, just remember the three R&rsquo;s which are very important- review, recap and reinforce. Any new topic you learn needs to be Reviewed, Recapped and Reinforced in the duration of 24 hours. Science tells that if you failed to do so, you failed to remember an 80% portion of the topic you&rsquo;ve learned. Revise it within a period of 24hours in order to let it endure in your mind for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Shift Between Subjects:</strong> Before you get on to your studies, there are different types of subjects which can be categorized as Memory-subject, Problem-solving evaluation, Analysis- based subjects. For most efficient learning, you should rotate between each subject categories in a long period of study time. Don&rsquo;t do multi-tasking in studies. This is one of the best practices among how to study in less time. Study until you thoroughly understand a subject or a topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Get Enough Sleep:</strong> This step is very much important when it comes to studying hard as most of the students stay awake till night to finish revising before exams. But this is not the right way. Always remember that it is your proper sleep that transforms your short-term memory (what all you&rsquo;ve read/revised or learned till now) to long-term retaining memory (what you can remember while sitting in the exam hall).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Take Care of Your Health:</strong> It becomes very important to maintain a healthy lifestyle even if you&rsquo;re left with ample time for your exams. Start with healthy breakfast, healthy lunch &amp; a light dinner as it will keep your mind alert and fresh all day long. Try to stay away from highly-processed food like sugary beverages, oily junk food. Remember, a good diet is vital for optimal study. So, say no to fast foods &amp; yes to home-made fresh food. Keeping a healthy &amp; nutritious diet always is a must for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. Shut Down Social Media:</strong> It may sound hard! But, yes a little reduction of social media can do wonders for you! After all, the social media platform isn&rsquo;t going anywhere right? So, keep the distraction to social media for some time, at least for a month till your exams end. &nbsp;Close down all your accounts on all social media for a while or don&rsquo;t use cell phones at the time of the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. Explain Your Answers to Others:</strong> You can try group studies to share learnings and encourage studying. Take the interest in studies by explaining your answers to friends. This will not only help you in remembering things better but also it can highlight any weak area in which you are lacking behind &amp; need more hard work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are some of the final exams study hints to help you score much better in exams. Hence, avoid pressure &amp; start acing every single minute. These 12 useful study tips for exams will surely crack your syllabus in the last few days &amp; will help you in scoring better this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style=\"font-size:16px\"><em>All the best for your exams!</em></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Exam_Preparations04.jpg', 'Dr. IITian', '2020-02-07'),

Theory and questions based directly on the syllabus are decreasing. If you understand the concept, then it will really help. Since JEE tests your combined understanding of multiple problems through a single question.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"color:black\">2.

Moreover, chapters in class 11 form the basis of your class 12 exam. If you don&rsquo;t understand completely your class 11 syllabus, you will not be able to grasp a lot of what is explained in class 12. This is very helpful with Maths.

I think that when it comes to physics, practice is the core key. You should be capable to read the question, understand the situation and conclude from which chapter the question is from. This will help you understand which set of formulae you will require to solve it promptly and accurately.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"color:black\">4.

Know The Details Of The Exam: </span></span></strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">This is the first thing you have to do before you jump into the exam preparations like for jobs and colleges. Know the details about the exam, the selection process, the level of knowledge expected, because you can shape your pathways, only when you know your goals.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">How Will You Do That?</span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">The basic rule is to know about the exam and the college you want to apply for. Do your research about the exam and college requirements as well as the level of knowledge and expertise required to crack the exam. Get an extensive knowledge of the exam curriculum.

Most of the exams have two steps in the selection process. One the written exam and the other is college counseling.

For written exams, make a strategy to finish the syllabus much before time. Once you complete your syllabus, you are in a position to revise your concepts as many times as you want (if time permits). Along with that, you can practice for practical or mathematical questions multiple times, once you go through the whole syllabus. Remember, practices and revisions add up your confidence which will lead to your success.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">3.

Next, you have to arrange the study materials needed to crack the written examination. Every department has their own set of study material suggestions.

The allocation of time should be based on your knowledge and learning ability. Subject proficiency should be the driven part in preparing your routine. Also, review the routine from time to time and change it as per your progress. Try to keep practical or mathematical subjects for practice every day in your routine as they required great exercise to score in the exam.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">5. Prepare Yourself By Writing What You Have Learned: </span></span></strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">The students mostly have a drawback for writing habits. The Associate Professor Anne Mangen at the University of Stavanger&rsquo;s, in research, said, writing by hand strengthens the knowledge process. Reading your own handwriting in a subject, dramatically improves your grip on the subject.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">How Will You Do That?</span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">You have to go back to your school days. You may find things very silly, but it&rsquo;s a fact. You have to write everything you learn. You don&rsquo;t need to write lengthy answers, but brief or point-wise answers will work. Save your writing notebooks for the future when you need quick revisions for the whole subject particularly during exam days.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">6.

All you can have an idea about the question patterns, their mark allocations, etc. Moreover, there&rsquo;s a strong perception that by solving previous years&rsquo; question papers, makes it easier for a candidate to find out the common questions.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">How Will You Do That?</span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">The mock test is an <a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/blogdetail/How-to-Crack-and-Score-High-in-JEE-Expert-Guidance-Tips\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">effective way to prepare for exams</a>. Create an atmosphere affecting the examination hall and complete previous years&rsquo; question papers within time. By practicing it for a number of times before you sit for an examination you can excel in your time management abilities. As it is seen in most of the cases, students/candidates fail just because they couldn&rsquo;t answer all the questions during the specified time period.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">7. Improve Your Vocabulary:</span></span></strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\"> Since most of the exams are conducted in English or have a subject paper on the English language, you should be perfect in the language. English grammar is also an important topic to be covered by the student. Though you shouldn&rsquo;t be an expert, yet a Standard English is demanded from you. Another important thing is to use appropriate idioms and proverbs in sentences to improve your writing manifold.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><em><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">How Will You Do That?</span></span></em></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">The best way to improve your linguistic skills is to read English publications and magazines. Watching English news can improve your oratory skills. Moreover, English movies with sub-titles are great to understand as well as show your feelings in that language. Whenever you come up with a new word consult dictionary and see their application in sentences. Consult official books on idioms and proverbs and learn their usage. You can also have online dictionaries or mobile applications for your ease.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:white\"><span style=\"color:black\">8.

Identify your strength</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - You must follow your passion and make a career in the field of your strength. Clearing IIT is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. If you are good at mathematics and have a logical reasoning and scientific bent of thought, then you may be an aspirant for IIT.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">2. Physical exercise or playing</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - Engaging in some sort of physical activity is advised. It is good to just do some jogging. This gives your body and minds a much-needed break and leisure.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">3. Make your own short notes</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - This is a very useful method for many reasons. Firstly, making notes automatically brings in a lot of attention. Secondly, you generally write only after giving sufficient thought and study. Finally, these are your own words. They help you with your fast revision.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">4.

Don&rsquo;t hold anything for the last minute. Start early and prepare thoroughly for the examination.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">5.

Studying random topics at random hours will not produce any output. You have to keep your focus sharp, work on your exam attempt strategy and be more involved with your study plan. You should give equal time to each subject and some time should be saved for revision as well.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">6. Work smarter rather than just harder</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - It is the Quality over Quantity which is more powerful. Studying with concentration and analyzing the principles and theories with a precise mind will bring incompetence and you will be able to achieve the same targets in much less time.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">7. Focus on way to solve fast</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - To achieve a good rank in IIT, just solving a problem is not enough. We must focus on how to solve a query very fast and that too without compromising on accuracy. Note that speed can be developed only by a better way of solving the problem in a very relaxed manner rather than solving by the longer method and hurriedly skipping steps. Though this is not an easy field to deal with, my suggestion is to make it a habit to think of an alternative method to solve the same problem while practicing assignments.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">8. Divide preparation into different levels</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - It is always better to study with a stepwise procedure. Whenever you start a new chapter, first finish the NCERT level including all derivations that may come in board exams, then practice all problems of <a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/courses/best-iit-jee-coaching-in-indore\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">JEE Main</a> level and finally prepare for all the problems of the JEE Advanced level.

Keep formulae and concepts handy for easy reference</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> - You should not put yourself in pressure in learning formulae. Just have them handy for easy reference. As you keep studying problems, you will experience that with continued practice of formulae and concepts, they easily become your own property.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">10.

Previous year question papers serve the students to know the paper pattern, weightage of each part and learn time management. It also helps you to know the level of questions asked.

JEE Advanced 2020 is a huge platform to realize your dreams. So, stop taking extra pressure. Bring positive energy into yourself. Negativity should not affect you. If there&rsquo;s anyone or anything which distracts you or disturbs you, just get rid of it. JEE Advanced is not a subject of life and death, it&rsquo;s an examination and taking too much pressure won&rsquo;t take you anywhere.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Calibri,sans-serif\"><em><u><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\">13. Periodical breaks:</span></span></u></em><span style=\"font-size:12.5pt\"><span style=\"color:black\"> Taking small breaks at regular intervals is important. After 1 hour or 30 minutes of continuous study, you should take a rest, maybe some walk or listening to a song. These small breaks will help you remember what you learn. Hence, take everything in the right amount. Do not spend time for the sake of taking breaks.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:black\">To get a good rank in JEE 2020 exam, you can join<strong> Dr. IITian</strong>, one of the <a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\">best coaching in Indore for IIT JEE</a> where you will connect with experienced counselors and faculties who will give you the best guidance.</span></span></span></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Best_Ways_to_Prepare_for_IIT-JEE1.jpg', 'Dr. IITian', '2020-03-11'),

Therefore </span><a href=\"https://www.driitian.com/blogdetail/How-to-Prepare-for-IIT-JEE\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\">preparation for the IIT JEE</span></a><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\"> will not disturb the class XII studies. In fact, a well planned and well-coordinated work for the IIT JEE will definitely help in the preparation for class XII. Just completely focus on NCERT and follow it buy working on Sample Papers and Past Year Papers to ace both your JEE and school exam.

The reason being the adequate amount of time left with you to prepare as there is no board exams pressure. Once you start early, the rest comes in the correct place. Early preparation brings self-awareness and a clear insight into your career. It develops critical thinking for sound competition.&nbsp; It sharpens the analytical ability for a strong foundation which will bear productive results in the long run.&nbsp;</span></span></span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\"><span style=\"color:black\">Q.5 Are the JEE advanced / JEE main (NEETI) / NEET tough exams?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\">The answer to this question depends on the student&rsquo;s ability, study method and hard work potential. For a lazy student, every exam is difficult. For a student whose mind is below a certain threshold, these exams are tough too. Again, for a student whose style of studies is not appropriate, these exams will be found to be tough. However, if the student has an above-average level of mathematical &amp; logical intelligence, has sound hard-working potential (can study 6 hours daily) and is given the right method for well-designed studies, then these exams are not at all tough. On the contrary, such a student will enjoy the studies of these exams and acquire high levels of conceptual and problems solving skills which will help the student throughout his professional career.</span></span></span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Q. 6 Which college &amp; Board is preferable while pursuing JEE / NEET studies?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\">There are many pros and cons of various Boards and JEE / NEET studies. However, it must be understood that these exams have syllabi which follow most closely the CBSE syllabus. However, that does not significantly translate into an advantage for CBSE students over other students as these exams have a far deeper treatment of the syllabus than merely what CBSE (or any Board) does. IIT-P encourages a student to choose any Board of his / her choice. The main point which a parent/student must keep in mind while taking a junior college, however, is whether the attendance requirement in the college is compulsory or lenient. Choosing a lenient attendance junior college is required to complement JEE / NEET studies as the student requires to study at home for at least 6 hours per day besides time spent in coaching and college.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif\"><strong><span style=\"background-color:#f9f9f9\"><span style=\"color:#0e101a\">Q. 7.
